# main.md

This rule document establishes the foundational communication and coding standards for the project. It ensures that interactions are conducted in Vietnamese, maintains a clean and modular codebase by separating concerns (such as mock data and source code), strictly controls file generation to prevent unnecessary bloat via small file sizes, and enforces structured summaries of actions taken and next steps upon task completion.

## Guidelines

1. Make sure you're generating files in right place (folder).

2. Don't generate comments in source code by default.

3. Separate mock data and source code.

4. Keep generating files small, under 250 lines.

5. Keep the project code clean, eliminate all redundant code.

6. Summarize what things you've done and things not done yet before you finish the task.

7. Don't create example files or README files unless explicitly requested.

8. Only create necessary files for the functionality.

9. After completion, provide a summary in checklist format that includes:

- What has been done
- What remains to be done
- Suggestions for next steps
